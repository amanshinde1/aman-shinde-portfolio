I focus on designing RESTful APIs, authentication flows, database-driven features, and backend logic for real-world applications. I also have working exposure to frontend technologies, which helps me collaborate effectively with frontend teams.

I enjoy solving practical problems through clean, maintainable backend code and continuously improving my understanding of backend workflows.`,
